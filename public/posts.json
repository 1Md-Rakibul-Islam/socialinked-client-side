        "description": "Per the United Nations, “only 50 percent of women of working age are in the labor force, compared to 77 per cent of men. Women are found to remain concentrated in low paid jobs and earn on average between 70 and 90 per cent of what men earn.” Countering this trend is The Unspoken Smiles Foundation which, with its Unspoken Smiles Fellowship, is empowering women throughout the developing world. This program, open to women ages 18-35, trains them to become dental assistants through a condensed, five week-long courses as well as a two month-long externship at a local dental office. Supervised and trained by licensed professionals, this world-class curriculum educates the fellows in clinical, radiographic and administrative procedures, as well as how to operate the various instruments and equipment found in modern dental offices. But more than simple instruction, each fellow is assigned a Dentist and Dental Hygienist who functions as a mentor and provides personal and professional guidance as they navigate their new career. The benefits of this are many because not only are these women attaining a higher degree of educational and economic opportunity, but the denizens of these developing countries, who often have no access to dental care, are able to receive treatment on a consistent, local basis.
